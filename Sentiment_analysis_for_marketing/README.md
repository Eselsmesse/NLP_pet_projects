# Techniques Employed
In order to get a deeper understanding of peopleâ€™s opinion about video games, you will employ various NLP techniques.  The main topics covered in the work.

* Sampling from imbalanced datasets using the imbalanced-learn package
* Enquiring about the sentiment value of the reviews with the dictionary-based sentiment analysis tools, which are part of NLTK, a natural language processing toolkit, used in Python.
* Finding out if algorithm did a good job. Data evaluation with scikit-learn in Python.
* Evaluating your model and creating descriptive statistics in Python with scikit-learn library before reporting your results.



# The project is made up of five steps, which are built on each other:

* Creating your dataset.
* Creating a dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.
* Evaluating your dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.
* Creating neural network-based sentiment analyzers.
* Reporting your results.
* Both the steps and the techniques in this project model a real-life scenario. If you are employed as an NLP Specialist, you are likely to accomplish jobs like these ones.
